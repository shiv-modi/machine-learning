    "Lasso regression is a type of regression model designed to prevent overfitting by adding a regularization term to the traditional linear regression. This model not only helps in reducing overfitting but also serves as a feature selection technique. If a feature is not strongly correlated with the target, lasso regression can set its corresponding coefficient exactly to zero, effectively excluding it from the model. In the context of gradient descent, as the regularization parameter (位位) increases, the model becomes more aggressive in shrinking the coefficients, with the effect that less important features may be reduced to very small values or precisely to zero"
